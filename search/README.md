Create a front-end interface for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.

Requirements

1. Pages

Your website must include at least three pages:
	•	Google Search Page
	•	Google Image Search Page
	•	Google Advanced Search Page

On the Google Search page, links in the upper-right corner should navigate to Image Search and Advanced Search. Similarly, on both the Image Search and Advanced Search pages, there should be a link in the upper-right corner to return to the main Google Search page.

2. Search Features

Standard Search
	•	Users should be able to enter a query in the search bar and click “Google Search” to be taken to the Google search results page.
	•	The search bar should be centered, have rounded corners, and the search button should be positioned below it, following Google’s style.

Image Search
	•	Users should be able to enter a query and click a button to be directed to Google’s Image Search results.

Advanced Search
	•	The Advanced Search page should include four input fields, matching Google’s own advanced search options:
	•	Find pages with… “all these words:”
	•	Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
	•	Find pages with… “any of these words:”
	•	Find pages with… “none of these words:”
	•	The fields should be stacked vertically, left-aligned, and styled similarly to Google’s Advanced Search page.
	•	The “Advanced Search” button should be blue with white text, consistent with Google’s design. Clicking it should take users to the corresponding search results.

3. Additional Features

“I’m Feeling Lucky” Button
	•	Add an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button on the Google Search page.
	•	Clicking this button should take users directly to the first search result, bypassing the regular search results page.

4. Aesthetics & Styling
	•	The website’s CSS should closely match Google’s design for a familiar and polished look.
